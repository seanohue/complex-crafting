# complex-crafting

A more complex crafting bundle for RanvierMUD.

## Current features

- Resource-based crafting (similar to simple-crafting)
- Item-based crafting (consumes existing inventory items to create a new one)
- Tools (items that you need for a recipe but are not consumed)
- Enhanced crafting commands such as craft search
- Initial support for concepts such as 'blueprints' or learning recipes.

## Future features

- More configurability (so one can remove resource-based if they want, or change how crafts are listed)
- More support for item-based crafting
- More support for the concept of learning recipes, or a crafting tree
- Support for a crafting skill
