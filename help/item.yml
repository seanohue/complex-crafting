  An item is anything in Myelin that can be found or crafted, and that will take up space in your inventory.
  
  Some items can be worn or wielded, and others can be used or otherwise consumed.

  Some items can be used as containers, to hold other items and expand your inventory space.

  Some items are useful only for trade, while others can be used to craft other items, either as tools or ingredients.

  Items that are crafting ingredients but do not take up an inventory slot are called 'resources'. They are a currency of sorts.
